A rocket ship that appears in the bottom center of the screen 
in Alien Invasion is controlled by the player. With the arrow 
keys, the player can move the ship right and left and shoot 
bullets with the spacebar. A fleet of aliens fills the sky at
the start of the game and marches up and down the screen. The
aliens are shot and killed by the player. A fresh fleet that
advances more quickly than the previous fleet arises if the
player kills all the aliens. The player loses a ship whenever
an alien touches their ship or touches the bottom of the screen. 
The game is over if a player loses three ships.
